# üìö Go Learn

This is a simple webscraper to access the api of the intranet at DTU. The intranet is using the [Desire2Learn](https://docs.valence.desire2learn.com/reference.html) API so every possible endpoint is available at their website. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As a student you dont have permission to use all endpoints. 

You can use this api for automation of tasks related to your user, and if you get extra permissions from the administration you will be able to manage other users as well.

Right now the webscraper is implemented as a library but later it might also get a TUI

## üõ†Ô∏è Todo

- [ ] Finish implementing the endpoints from python
- [ ] Make tests on endpoints
- [ ] Automize implementaion of endpoints from the reference
- [ ] Parse and return types from the functions.
- [ ] Make a TUI for simple use cases
- [ ] Make tests of all endpoints and register which are not available for students
